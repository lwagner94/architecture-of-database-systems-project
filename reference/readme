## DEXTER version 1.4 (August 20, 2011) ##
##########################################

All implementations created within the DEXTER project are open-source and 
licensed under BSD. 


Quick Start Guide:
------------------
* 0) Unittests MIT Benchmark
  - cd <dexter>/src
  - make unittest
  - ./IXServer_unit

* 1) Standard MIT Benchmark
  - cd <dexter>/src
  - make harness_test
  - ./speed_test 1468 0 0 0 0 4000 16000

* 2) Basic Functionality Test (insert, get, getNext, delete)
  - cd <dexter>/src
  - make tu
  - ./IXServer_tu

* 3) All the tests from above
  - cd <dexter>/src
  - make all 
  - ./IXServer_tu
  - ./IXServer_unit
  - ./speed_test 1468 0 0 0 0 4000 16000

* 4) Compile and run all the tests
  - cd <dexter>/src
  - make test 



Additional Experiments:
-----------------------
* see <dexter>/src/exp and <dexter>/src/makefile for all 
  experiments and compilation targets (includes experiments
  for core indexing and in-memory query processing) 


Configuration:
--------------
* All parameters can be configured in <dexter/src/IXStruct.h>
* This includes for example (1) the amount of preallocated memory, (2) the
  prefix length and related nodes sizes, as well as (3) many switches for
  specific optimization techniques (e.g., compressed pointers, bypass 
  jumper arrays etc)
* By default most of the optimization techniques are turned off and we use
  a well-balanced prefix length (w.r.t. data distributions, data types and
  operations)


Notes:
------
* In case of any problems with compilation, usage, or repeatability/workability 
  of experiments, please do not hesitate to contact Matthias Boehm 
  (matthias.boehm@tu-dresden.de).
* The index server has been primarily tested on a 64bit Fedora 14  
* However, in general the source code could be used for 32/64bit and different
  operating systems
